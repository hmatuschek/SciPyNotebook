SciPy Studio
============

This project is dedicated but not related to the SciPy project (http://scipy.org).

I am a physisist that deals a lot with time-series analysis and statistics. My main workhorse is
python especially numpy and scipy. Unfortunately there is no proper solution hack python live.
The python console or iPython are nice tools but are not practical if one has to write more than
one line of code. On the otherside, writing scripts is not pratically because they need to be
re-run completely just to play around with the calculated results. So I searched for a
intermediate solution and could not find something.

As usually, I decided to write my own.

The concept is quiet simple and is not new: the notebook. An example can be seen in the wxMaxima
application that nicely integrates the hacking comfort of an editor with the flexability of a
command line. There is even a nice program called Notebook that works with python, but only for
MacOS X.
